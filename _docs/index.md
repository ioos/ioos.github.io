### **DMAC Implementation Requirements and Guidelines for IOOS Data Providers**
The Data Management and Communication (DMAC) Implementation Requirements site outlines the processes US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS) data providers must comply with in order to properly implement an IOOS DMAC system.  This resource, published on IOOS' official NOAA website, represents the overall procedural requirements in order for data providers to contribute their data to the IOOS data management enterprise.  
* [DMAC Implementation Requirements for IOOS Data Providers](https://ioos.noaa.gov/data/contribute-data/)

The individual documentation sites listed below provide the specific technical guidance as it pertains to the overall high-level requirements outlined in the IOOS Data Contributor site.  The software and tools section contains links to several resources data providers can use to assist in this process.


### **IOOS Metadata Profile**
The IOOS Metadata Profile contains dataset attribution guidelines and examples to help the US IOOS community publish datasets in netCDF and other related data formats in an interoperable manner.  The goal of the metadata profile is to allow users of IOOS' data services, such as ERDDAP, THREDDS, OPeNDAP, and SOS, seamless access and use across individual IOOS data providers' services.

## **Software, Tools, and Projects**
A collection of IOOS-developed software tools that data providers can use to publish DMAC-compliant datasets and services.  Also included in this list are IOOS projects that aggregate datasets throughout the IOOS enterprise as a whole for search and discovery, and demonstrate usage of IOOS DMAC services for scientific analysis.
* * *

### **IOOS Compliance Checker**
The IOOS Compliance Checker is a python based tool for data providers to check for completeness and community standard compliance of local or remote netCDF files against CF and ACDD file standards. The python module can be used as a command-line tool or as a library that can be integrated into other software.  There is also a web-based version of Compliance Checker for users who want to test their own datasets but do not wish to download the software.

### **IOOS CodeLab**
The IOOS CodeLab is a collection [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)-based tutorials and examples of how to access and utilize the many IOOS technologies and data sources available. This site is geared towards scientists and environmental managers interested in “diving deep” into the numbers and creating original plots and data analysis. Most notebook examples are written in Python, however, there are also notebooks written in Matlab, and R.

### **IOOS Data Catalog**
IOOS operates the IOOS Data Catalog to facilitate search and discovery of datasets and services.  The Catalog represents the full enterprise inventory of IOOS network datasets and services.  It is an open data catalog powered by CKAN and pycsw that allows web-based search, discovery, and preview, as well as machine-to-machine query via OGC CS-W service and a custom REST API.  All IOOS data providers must convert their [IOOS Metadata Profile](https://ioos.github.io/#ioos-metadata-profile)-compliant datasets and corresponding services and represent them in ISO 19115 XML metadata records, which can then be registered with the IOOS Data Catalog.  The registration process is handled by the IOOS Harvest Registry, a companion product to the Data Catalog.  The Harvest Registry includes both a web UI and API for programmatic-registration of datasets.

### **MBON Portal**
The MBON Portal provides access to and interactive visualizations of data associated with the [Marine Biodiversity Observation Network (MBON)](https://ioos.noaa.gov/project/bio-data/). The portal includes real-time, delayed-mode, and historical data for in situ and remotely-sensed physical, chemical, and biological observations. This observation data is focused on organisms from microbes to whales, including measures of biodiversity (e.g. presence, abundance), productivity, genomics, phenology, and other relevant ecological process measurements or indices. Also featured are habitat characterization and habitat diversity measures, including satellite data and added-value data derived from satellite observations, and neural network model results, such as biogeographical seascape classifications. Featured in this portal are biodiversity indices that have been computed for key biological datasets within the MBON regions.
